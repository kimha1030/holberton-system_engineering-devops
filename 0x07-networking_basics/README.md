## Terminology

* OSI Model (Open System Interconnection): 
Is logical and conceptual model that defines network communication used by systems for to open a interconnection and communication with other systems. Also, defines a logical network and describes compiter packet transfer by using various layers of protocols.
The OSI model is used for understand communication over a network and allows us to compare primary functional relationships on various network layers.

The upper layers resolve the applications issues and are implemented only in software.
The lower layers handle activities related to data transport. The physical layer and datalink layers also implemented in software and hardware.

The seven layers are:
» Physical (layer 1): Describes the mechanical and electrical details of network components such as cables, connectors, and network interfaces.
» Data link (layer 2): Describes the basic techniques that networks use to uniquely identify devices on the network (typically via a MAC address) and the means for one device to send information over the physical layer to another device, in the form of data packets. Switches operate at the data link layer, which means that they manage the efficient transmission of data packets from one device to another.
» Network (layer 3): Handles the routing of data across networks. Routers operate at the network layer.
» Transport (layer 4): Provides for reliable delivery of packets.
» Session (layer 5): Establishes sessions between network applications.
» Presentation (layer 6): Converts data so that systems that use different data formats can exchange information.
» Application (layer 7): Allows applications to request network services.

* Network interface: Is the electronic circuitry that allows a device to connect to a network. Each network interface provides a port, which is the plug-in point for the interface.

Every network interface must have a unique identifier (**MAC address** or MAC stands for media access control). Each MAC address is unique throughout the entire world.
